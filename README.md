# Sim-Project

In this project, I created a full Yahtzee simulatton with four disttnct strategies to determine which strategy
performs better than the others. The four strategies varied which sections were filled out first and if point
opportunities were checked in between each roll. The strategy that performed the best was filling out the
bottom section of the scorecard first while checking for point opportunities. The 95% confidence interval
for the mean is [191.121, 191.403]. This strategy performed much better than the other strategies so is
therefore the optimal strategies of the ones I coded.
